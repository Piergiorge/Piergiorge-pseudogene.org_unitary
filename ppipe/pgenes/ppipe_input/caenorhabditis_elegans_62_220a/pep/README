IMPORTANT: Please note you can download correlation data tables,
supported by Ensembl, via the highly customisable BioMart and
EnsMart data mining tools. See http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview or

Fasta Peptide dumps

These files hold the protein translations of Ensembl gene predictions.

-----------
FILE NAMES
------------
The files are consistently named following this pattern:
   <species>.<assembly>.<release>.<sequence type>.<status>.fa.gz

<species>:       The systematic name of the species.
<assembly>:      The assembly build name.
<release>:       The release number.
<sequence type>: pep for peptide sequences
<status>
  * 'pep.all' - the super-set of all translations resulting from Ensembl known
     or novel gene predictions.
  * 'pep.abinitio' translations resulting from 'ab initio' gene
     prediction algorithms such as SNAP and GENSCAN. In general, all
     'ab initio' predictions are based solely on the genomic sequence and
     not any other experimental evidence. Therefore, not all GENSCAN
     or SNAP predictions represent biologically real proteins.
fa : All files in these directories represent FASTA database files
gz : All files are compacted with GNU Zip for storage efficiency.

EXAMPLES (Note: Most species do not sequences for each different <status>)
 for Human:
    Homo_sapiens.NCBI36.40.pep.all.fa.gz
      contains all known and novel peptides
    Homo_sapiens.NCBI36.40.pep.abinitio.fa.gz
      contains all abinitio predicted peptide

Difference between known and novel
----------------------------------
Protein models that can be mapped to species-specific entries in
Swiss-Prot, RefSeq or SPTrEMBL are referred to in Ensembl as
known genes.  Those that cannot be mapped are called novel
(e.g. genes predicted on the basis of evidence from closely related species).

For models annotated by HAVANA the status is set manually. Models that have 
an HGNC name are referred to as known and the remaining models are referred to
as novel.

-------------------------------
FASTA Sequence Header Lines
------------------------------
The FASTA sequence header lines are designed to be consistent across
all types of Ensembl FASTA sequences.  This gives enough information
for the sequence to be identified outside the context of the FASTA
database file.

General format:

>ID SEQTYPE:STATUS LOCATION GENE TRANSCRIPT

Example of Ensembl Peptide header:

>ENSP00000328693 pep:novel chromosome:NCBI35:1:904515:910768:1 gene:ENSG00000158815:transcript:ENST00000328693
